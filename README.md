#Zomato Dataset Analysis and Visualization

1. Project Title : Zomato Dataset Analysis and Visualization: Insights into Global Restaurant Trends
2. Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized to carry out the analysis and visualization of the Zomato dataset:
- NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.
- Seaborn: For advanced data visualizations with enhanced aesthetics.
- Plotly: For interactive and dynamic visualizations (if applicable).

3. Data Operations
Several data operations were performed to clean, preprocess, and transform the dataset for analysis:
- Data Cleaning:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Removing duplicates.
  - Standardizing inconsistent data formats (e.g., currency, text case).

- Feature Engineering:
  - Creating new columns (e.g., price ranges, rating categories).
  - Encoding categorical variables for analysis.

- Data Exploration:
  - Checking for null values.
  - Analyzing the structure of the dataset (e.g., data types, dimensions).

4. Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to uncover trends and patterns in the Zomato dataset:
- Top Restaurant Chains: Identified the most popular restaurant chains based on the number of outlets.
- Cuisines Analysis: Explored the distribution of cuisines offered globally.
- Location Trends: Analyzed the concentration of restaurants in different cities and countries.
- Cost Distribution: Examined price range trends and their relationship with customer ratings.
- Ratings Insights: Investigated patterns in customer ratings and reviews.

5. Data Visualization
Visualizations were created to provide insights into the dataset. Some key visualizations include:
- Bar Charts:
  - Top cuisines offered across different cities.
  - Popularity of restaurant chains.

- Scatter Plots:
  - Relationship between restaurant cost and customer ratings.

- Pie Charts:
  - Distribution of price ranges or cuisines.

- Heatmaps:
  - Correlation between various numerical features (e.g., cost, ratings).

- Geographical Maps (if applicable):
  - Mapping restaurant densities across cities and countries.
